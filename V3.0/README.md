Zeesoft V3.0 architecture
=========================
The Zeesoft V3.0 architecture is based on the new Zeesoft Development Kit (ZDK).
This is a departure from previous full stack Zeesoft architectures.
A major benefit of this approach is improved separation of valuable logic from its implementation.
The logic will be exposed through libraries which will then be used to create products.
All ZDK based libraries and products will be self testing and self documenting.

Libraries;
 * [ZDK](https://github.com/DyzLecticus/Zeesoft/blob/master/V3.0/ZDK/) Zeesoft Development Kit
