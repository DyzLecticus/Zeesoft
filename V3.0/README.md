Zeesoft V3.0 architecture
=========================
The Zeesoft V3.0 architecture is based on the new Zeesoft Development Kit (ZDK).
This is a departure from previous full stack Zeesoft architectures.
A major benefit of this approach is improved separation of valuable logic from its implementation.

To demonstrate the ZDK, it will be used to create an artificial cognition.
The artificial cognition will be implemented in a local chat bot.
