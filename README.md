Zeesoft products
================
Have you ever tried to create a serious multi user client server Java application that requires object persistence?
Pretty soon you'll be looking at Maven, Spring, Hibernate, SQL databases and a long list of Apache libraries.
You spend months learning all that stuff, knitting it all together to suit your purpose and you have not even started on the GUI.
All you wanted to do is write some cool Java code but now when you try to build your project, 
Maven starts downloading the internet and then breaks your build.
Zeesoft products are created to avoid all that noise and let you focus on writing that cool Java code.
