Technical Evolutionary Business Strategy
========================================

Introduction
------------
Today, IT is more dominant than ever within many large companies.
Large companies often have an old IT infrastructure and have difficulty keeping it up to date within an increasingly dynamic business environment.
Many large companies see their business threatened by smaller start up companies that do not have to deal with legacy IT systems and are able to transform new ideas into viable products and services at a much faster pace.
This proposal aims to describe a way to apply understanding of evolutionary processes and human(e) organization to modern business strategy, using an IT first approach.

Case
----
In order to demonstrate this idea we use a random large financial services company we call "X Finance".
X Finance has used its resources wisely to modernize its legacy architecture but it depends on several big name IT vendors to design, build and maintain it.
Hardware and infrastructure are provided and maintained by "X IT", business services are provided and maintained by "Y IT" and front end development is provided and maintained by "Z IT".
All these IT suppliers aim to provide high quality services at competing prices but are also very aware of their own interests.

Evolution
---------
For this case I propose to implement what I call a Technical Evolutionary Business Strategy, or TEBS.
Imagine X Finance creates two children, "A Finance" and "B Finance". 
These child companies are created internally, not as separate legal entities.
They are created using the same 'DNA' (culture, processes, innate environment knowledge etcetera) as their parent, but with mutations in their technical implementation.
These yet 'unborn' children are allowed to choose which architecture they implement and on what hardware they implement it.
This can be seen as choosing the hardware and software for the brain and neural network of the child company.
I propose for our example case that A Finance follows its parent closely with regard to architecture but with perhaps some minor mutation in the front end (i.e. App focus in stead of Web focus).
I also propose that B Finance goes completely open source and perhaps maintains its own hardware and infrastructure (using scalable patterns and products).
Both children start by only implementing and focusing on a small part of the X Finance business, depending on the expected viability.
The children have the advantage of being able to offer the same service (quality / up time) but at a lower cost, or a lower level of service for an even lower price, or perhaps an extended service for a higher price.

Interface
---------
In order for these companies to communicate internally in a technical sense, a common interface for exchanging internal business information needs to be developed.
Parents and children need to speak, more or less, the same language.
Languages change by children inventing and adopting new words and phrases to suit their needs.

Platform
--------
This interface is an opportunity to create a platform through which customers and external companies can communicate with both the parent and the children.
Such a technical platform can allow third party interface developers to extend the services landscape, creating a rich environment for customers to find the service they need.
This platform can be seen as a village market place, owned and maintained by the parent and child companies together.
Evolution is often thought of in terms of competition but for social species like humans, cooperation and technical innovation are of greater importance.

Generations
-----------
It is important that the process of creating the child companies is both planned and documented extensively.
This will improve the speed and efficiency of that process for future generations and perhaps even allow for future automation (generating a basic child company set up in some cloud).
At some point the parent company and or one of the children may no longer be able to survive in the business environment.
This is no problem for the platform as the company can be decoupled and then liquidated independently.

Conclusion
----------
TEBS is a long term strategy that improves the chances of a companies survival in an increasingly dynamic and increasingly technical environment.
In stead of market selection pressure operating on the entire company, it will be spread out across many independent entities within the company.
This creates a more robust whole and enhances the drive and ability to find and exploit new niches.
The open platform will allow for better cooperation with external companies, improving the chances of survival even further.
TEBS will create redundancy but this must be seen as a feature. 
If basic parent and child customer data and service capabilities are synchronized regularly, one can function as a back up for the other.
TEBS does not dictate to what degree evolution is guided or which internal companies (parents and or children) are guiding it. 
TEBS implementations and internal change mechanisms can be organized top down and/or bottom up.
TEBS does not depend on Agile/Scrum and DevOps but the cultures that those organizing principals encourage are thought to be very compatible with TEBS.
