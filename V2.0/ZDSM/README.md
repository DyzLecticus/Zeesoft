Zeesoft Domain Service Monitor
==============================
This program allows users to monitor and analyze trends for a set of processes and services across several domains. Processes are preprogrammed combinations of service requests that require complex data manipulation (like authentication and authorization mechanisms). The Zeesoft Domain Service Monitor extends the Zeesoft Object Database. As a result, this program itself can be extended programmatically to include a custom collection of preprogrammed processes (including a custom data model and default data set). The actual monitoring program runs in the background on the server. Every second it determines which domains require checking and then it starts all processes and fires all service requests that are applicable to those domains. Processes and service requests are handled by separate threads to prevent long response durations from clogging up the pipes. Process logs and service request responses are stored in the database including a boolean to indicate success. Configuring domains and services can be a time consuming task. In order to help backup and share configured domains and services, this program also provides a domain and service export and import function.
