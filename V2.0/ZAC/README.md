Zeesoft Artificial Cognition
============================
Zeesoft Artificial Cognition is a program that can produce artificial cognition.  

It is thought that cognition is the result of neural networks evolving to have parts of their behavioral control structures turned inwardly, creating virtual thinking muscles. It is also thought that every mental object is represented in the brain by a certain group of neurons expressing excitation. Human language capabilities are thought to be an innate result of cognition so the process that assembles symbols into thoughts is reflected in linguistic expression. This makes words and punctuation the ideal candidates to function as symbols. Knowledge is gained by learning the links between symbols in a stochastic manner. Knowledge is applied by using modules to evaluate all relevant links between symbols simultaniously.
