Superhero
=========
This project is about learning how to use Blender to create game assets.
The result of this project will be a complete low polygon superhero character that can be imported and used in JMonkeyEngine.
  
Many Blender tutorials about textures refer to Photoshop.
[Gimp](https://www.gimp.org/) is a free alternative that was used to create the texture for this asset.
